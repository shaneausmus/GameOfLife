# GameOfLife

This is my take on take on John Conway's Game Of Life. It's best displayed through your command line.
It probably isn't perfect as of now - my goal's to update this for efficiency, compatibility, and documentation's sake 
over the course of summer 2020.

Declaring an instance of the GameOfLife object is enough to be able to run the game, hence the reason
for the attached driver program.
